ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5MTdlOERREAE,"The Bayshore building is very clean, but it's evident that the building is aging. Some of the things like the crown moulding have separated joints, but overall it's a nice clean place and I was quite happy with it. It was great that there are so many trails to take advantage of for people like me that love the outdoors. I used the cross-country ski and snowshoe trails right on site and also did a little bit of ice skating. At the time of my stay there was no indoor dining (thanks COVID) and ended up getting a bit of a mix of room service and going into town for some takeout. The food from the room service was excellent but a little pricey, but the convenience made up for the higher price though. Overall, I would recommend Deerhurst Resort and really enjoyed my stay. I hope to visit again.",6 days ago,2021-02-23 14:25:24.736603,2021-02-17 14:25:24,4.0,Steven Ercolani,0,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113893853149857269296/reviews?hl=en
